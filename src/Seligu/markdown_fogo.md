## Mapping a vector into a landsat image
========================================================

*things we need for this worksheet*

* Landsat raster image B10 
* vector data_2014_subset 

*Before we start writing our code, we need to do some preprocessing*

load your requiered workspace and libraries

```r
library(sp)
library(raster)
library(rgdal)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(latticeExtra)
```



write a function for natural species, including the underlaying Landsat image, legend, colorramp for this vector natural species
